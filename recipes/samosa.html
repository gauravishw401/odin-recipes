     <h2> Description </h2>
     <p> The flavor and smell is the one that you think of when you think of Indian food: warm, spicy, fragrant. The pastry tasted good, but was quite crumbly. Modern samosa dough has baking powder in it, which wouldn't have been available at the time, but will make the samosas puff up and be nice and crispy.</p>
