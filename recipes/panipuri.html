        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Panipuri or golgappa is a deep-fried breaded hollow spherical shell - about 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter - filled with a combination of potatoes, raw onions, chickpeas, and spices. It is a common snack and street food in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> chickpeas</li>
            <li> mashed potatoes</li>
            <li> hollow fried puris</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green chilies and 1 inch ginger very well in water a few times. Drain all the water.

                Peel the ginger and roughly chop it. Also chop the green chilies. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and mint leaves. Don’t use the stem of mint leaves as they can make the spiced water have a bitter taste. Only use the fresh mint leaves.</li>
                <li> Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and green chili in a grinder or blender jar. For a less spicy pani you can add just 1 chopped green chilli.</li>
                <li> Add 1 tablespoon tightly packed tamarind and 3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder or grated jaggery.

                    If you do not have tamarind, then you can use 2 tablespoons lemon juice. You can also use equal amounts of jaggery and dates. So you can add 2 tablespoons crumbled jaggery and 2 tablespoons chopped dates.</li>
        </ol>
