    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> The dosa is made by soaking rice and lentils overnight in water and then grinding them into a batter. The batter is fermented overnight. To make the dosa the batter is spread on a hot tava using a ladle or a bowl. It is pan-roasted until crispy and served with potato curry, chutneys or sambar.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul> 
        <li> Rice Flour </li>
        <li> Semolina</li>
        <li> Sabudana</li>
        <li> Rava </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Add ½ cup urad dal (skinned black whole lentils), 2 tablespoon chana dal (bengal gram) and ½ teaspoon methi seeds to a large bowl/pot. Add 1½ cups raw rice to another bowl.</li>
        <li>Rinse dal thoroughly a few times and soak in lots of filtered water for 4 hours. During cold weather they can be soaked up to 6 hours or even overnight.</li>
        <li>Rinse rice too a few times until the water runs clear. Soak in enough filtered water for 4 hours. Same here as well, during cold weather they can be soaked up to 6 hours or even overnight.</li>
        <li>30 mins before blending the batter, rinse and soak 2 tablespoons poha (beaten rice) with ¼ cup filtered water for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Add soaked poha to the grinder jar or container first. Drain the water completely from dal and pour ¾ cup cold filtered water. (If you want to add salt read my faq section below to decide.)</li>
        <li> Blend until smooth, frothy and bubbly. If needed add more water. I add another 2 to 4 tablespoons water. But do not make it thin or runny. It must be a thick batter yet of pouring consistency. (Check video for consistency)</li>
    </ol>
